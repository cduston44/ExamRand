This here code will output a script that will generate a
bunch of randomized exams.

Instructions:

Too lazy for a makefile, compile with

gcc -o ExamRand ExamRand.c -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas

(yes, it does require GSL for the random number generation)

TEXFILE INSTRUCTIONS
This has only been tested with Philip Hirschorn's exam.cls class:
http://www-math.mit.edu/~psh/#ExamCls
 
In the tex file, write \Pa, \Pb, \Pc for the random variables.
In the parameter file, write max min steps for each of those variables.
The "steps" does nothing right now; maybe later it will be used 
for something.

Invoke with something like

./ExamRand example_param_file 5 1

(5 exams, some debugging messages)

Make the script executable with something like

chmod u+x Example_Exam_Script

and then run it:

./Example_Exam_Script

(Might want to do that twice, since we are dealing with LaTeX
and points for each problem need to be updated)

Check the results

evince Example_Exam-*.pdf

(or your favorite pdf reader).
